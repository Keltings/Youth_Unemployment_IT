## Introduction

This project aims to provide an interactive dashboard for analyzing population and education trends in different countries. The analysis is conducted using Python and its data visualization libraries, including pandas, Plotly, and Streamlit.
Getting Started

To use this code, follow the instructions below.
## Installation

    Clone this repository to your local machine using:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Keltings/Youth_Unemployment_IT.git
```
Navigate to the repository directory:

```bash
cd Youth_Unemployment_IT
```
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```
Install the required packages:
```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```    

## Data

The project utilizes two datasets:

    ken_rwa_pop.csv: Population data with demographic information
    ken_rwa_edu.csv: Education data with details on education levels and employment

## Data Preprocessing

The datasets are preprocessed to handle missing values and ensure data consistency.

## Population Analysis

The population analysis includes the following visualizations:

    Total inactive population by year and sex
    Total unemployed population by sex
    Total employed population by year and sex
    IT employment trends by year and gender

## Education Analysis

The education analysis includes the following visualizations:

    Education level distribution by age group
    Total unemployed population by education level and year
    Total employed population by education level and year
    Labor market trends by education level, unemployment categories, age group, and gender

## Running the Streamlit App

To run the Streamlit app:

    Make sure you are in the project directory with the virtual environment activated.
    Run the following command:

```bash
    streamlit run app.py
```
## Insights

The analysis provides insights into population and education trends, including employment rates, education levels, and more.
